Welcome to the collection of game projects implemented in C++! This repository contains three exciting games: Connect Four, 5x5, and Pyramids Four-Row. Each game offers a unique challenge and hours of entertainment. Let's dive into the details:
Connect Four

Connect Four:

is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of your color. The game is played on a 7x6 grid, and players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into the columns. The first player to connect four discs wins!

5x5:

5x5 is a strategic board game played on a 5x5 grid. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, aiming to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five pieces of their color. The challenge lies in outmaneuvering your opponent while also blocking their attempts to form a line.

Pyramids Four-Row:

Pyramids Four-Row is a captivating variation of the classic Connect Four game. The twist? Players can drop their discs into a pyramid-shaped grid, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. The goal remains the same: be the first to connect four discs of your color in a row, column, or diagonal.
